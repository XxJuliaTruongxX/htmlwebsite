# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is Julia Truong's personal portfolio website - a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript site showcasing her background as a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Minnesota.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main portfolio page with personal information, social links, and project sections
- `styles.css` - All styling using custom CSS with Josefin Sans font and pink/white color scheme
- `main.js` - JavaScript for scroll animations using Intersection Observer API
- `april_fools.html` - Easter egg page accessible from main site
- Static assets: background images, favicon, and other media files

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain consistent CSS class naming with lowercase and hyphens
- Keep JavaScript minimal and focused on enhancing user experience
- Use modern CSS features (flexbox, transitions) for responsive design
- Maintain accessibility with proper alt text and semantic markup

## Design Patterns
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- CSS animations triggered by scroll position
- Clean, minimalist layout with background images
- Pink (#ffa7a6) and white color scheme
- Josefin Sans font family throughout

## Key Features to Preserve
- Scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer
- Responsive button styling with hover effects
- Background image layouts
- Social media link integration (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)
- Consistent spacing and typography hierarchy

## When suggesting code changes:
1. Maintain the existing pink/white aesthetic
2. Ensure mobile responsiveness
3. Keep accessibility in mind
4. Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
5. Follow existing CSS class naming conventions
6. Test animations work smoothly across devices
