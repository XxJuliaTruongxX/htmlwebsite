        <h5> Very nice you guys, teamwork makes the dreamwork B).<br><br>

        When we were sitting together at the last hangout on Friday I didn’t do a speech because I would have literally bawled my eyes out for the rest of the night. However, now I can type this out in advance so I don't have to cry in front of anyone (fingers crossed). <br> <br>

        Extra thanks to Jim, Geoff, and Patrick for giving me the chance to be a part of the team after interviewing me,
        even though I didn’t join until a year later (better late than never). 
        I clearly remember my first impression of you guys when I first sat down and had our SCRAM meeting with everyone, “wow these guys are really really funny”. 
        So yeahhhh not to flatter you guys, but maybe flatter you guys a little bit, your guys' humor is awesome so keep spreading the cheer. 
        It really warms my heart how kind and welcoming your group dynamic is and I hope you’ll still let me be a part of that even though I’m working somewhere else now. 
        What you guys have is really special and I’d be dumb to just ghost you guys after this. 
        Expect updates from me, I don't know when or how often I'll update you guys, but even if I reach out 5 years later don’t be surprised when I say hi. <br> <br>

        I don't think most of you saw but some of you did, I've been bawling my eyes out during my last couple days on campus with you guys. 
        I have never cried after an internship finished but now look at me, I have been crying after every single term. I cried every time the other interns had to go back to school and now I am crying again because I am no longer working at NASA. 
        Regardless, that just means you guys mean a lot to me. I am very grateful to have been a part of your team and just a friend in your group overall. 
        If you ever take on more interns who are looking for a job, send them my way! <br> <br>

        Stay funny, <br>
