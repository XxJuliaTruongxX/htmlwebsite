                <h1> About Me </h1>
                <p> I'm a sophomore student at the University of Minnesota with an emphasis on Computer Science and Mathematics</p>
                <p> I've only been coding for a year but each semester with CS courses keeps getting better! I was originally a Mathematics major but absolutely fell in love with CS after taking a course and I still love it to this day! I am currently the Secretary and Intramurals co-organizer for the UMN League of Legends club. Some hobbies of mine include video games, anime, and drawing! </p>
